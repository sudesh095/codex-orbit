## About me

Hi, I’m **Sudesh Kumar**, a results-driven Android Developer with over **8 years** of experience
building high-performance mobile apps.

I specialize in **Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose**, and **modern Android architecture patterns** like
MVVM and Clean Architecture. Over the years, I’ve worked on everything from startups to
enterprise-grade apps—focusing on scalability, performance, and great user experiences.

This blog is my way of sharing what I’ve learned (and continue to learn) with the Android community.
Whether it’s code patterns, real project insights, or lessons from building in production—I’m here
to make Android development a little easier and a lot more fun.

I’ve also started my own venture called **Codex Orbit**, where I continue crafting clean, scalable
Android solutions. You can learn more or get in touch

Thanks for reading—and welcome to the journey!

# Understanding Memory Leaks in Android: A Hands-On Study

Memory leaks are one of the most common problems in Android development. They can lead to slow performance, app crashes, and frustrating user experiences. To help developers understand and prevent them, I created a small Android study app that demonstrates common memory leak scenarios and their safe alternatives, including examples in **Jetpack Compose**.

In this blog, I’ll walk you through the app and what you can learn from it.

---

## What You’ll Learn

This app covers a variety of memory leak situations, such as:

- **Context Leaks** – Holding references to an Activity or Context improperly.
- **View Leaks** – Views keeping a reference even after they are destroyed.
- **Handler Leaks** – Handlers or Runnables that prevent Activities from being garbage collected.
- **Coroutine Leaks** – Coroutines running beyond the lifecycle of an Activity or Fragment.
- **Receiver Leaks** – Broadcast receivers not unregistered correctly.
- **Adapter Leaks** – Adapters holding strong references to Activity contexts.
- **Large Collections / Bitmap Leaks** – Storing too much data or images without limiting memory usage.
- **Fragment Leaks** – Forgetting to clear binding objects in Fragments.
- **Jetpack Compose Leaks** – Observers or coroutines that aren’t disposed of correctly.

For each scenario, the app shows **both unsafe and safe implementations**, making it easier to understand what to avoid and how to fix it.

## Why Memory Leaks Happen

Memory leaks usually happen when objects hold references that prevent them from being cleaned up by the garbage collector. In Android, this often involves:

- Holding an **Activity or Context** reference longer than necessary.
- Not **nullifying views or bindings** in Fragments.
- Using **Handlers, Runnables, or Coroutines** without proper lifecycle management.
- Storing **large data objects or Bitmaps** without limits.

Even with Jetpack Compose, memory leaks can occur if you don’t handle **observers, coroutines, and state properly**.

---

## How the App Works

The study app is designed to be simple and interactive:

1. **Home Screen:** Buttons are grouped to trigger different leak examples.
2. **Activities and Compose Screens:** Demonstrate leaks and fixes for various scenarios.
3. **Safe vs Unsafe Examples:** Each scenario has a “leaky” and “fixed” version to make comparisons easy.
4. **Adapters and Bitmaps:** Shows the difference between holding Activity references vs using `applicationContext`, and unbounded vs bounded caches using `LruCache`.

You can run the app on a device or emulator and explore different leak scenarios to see how memory behaves.

---

## Learning Takeaways

- Memory leaks can **cause OutOfMemory (OOM) crashes** if ignored.
- Proper **lifecycle management** is essential to keep your app stable.
- Always use **applicationContext** instead of Activity context when possible.
- **Unregister receivers, clear views, and dispose of coroutines** properly.
- For Jetpack Compose, remember to manage **observers and state** to prevent leaks.
- Use tools like **LeakCanary** or the **Android Profiler** to identify leaks early.

---

## Why This Matters

Understanding memory leaks is a crucial skill for Android developers. Even small leaks can accumulate over time, slowing down your app or causing crashes. By studying common scenarios and implementing safe practices, you can write **more robust, performant, and user-friendly apps**.

---

## Final Thoughts

This project is a hands-on way to **learn, experiment, and practice** safe memory management in Android. Whether you are working with traditional Views or modern Jetpack Compose, the lessons are the same: **manage your references, respect the lifecycle, and clean up after yourself**.

You can explore the complete project on [GitHub](https://github.com/sudesh095/memory-leaks.git). Try running it, check the leaky and fixed examples, and start applying these safe practices in your own apps.

Happy Coding, Thanks!
